# Issue: Enhance File Search Capabilities [COMPLETED]

## Description

The current implementation of file search in the AI agent is basic and could be enhanced to provide more accurate and relevant responses with better citations. Improving the search capabilities would significantly enhance the agent's ability to retrieve knowledge and provide better responses.

## Implementation Tasks

1. Improve citation system to clearly reference source documents in responses
2. Implement file categorization for better knowledge retrieval
3. Add support for additional file formats beyond the current JSON and MD files
4. Implement relevance scoring for search results to prioritize more relevant information
5. Add semantic chunking for better context extraction from documents

## Technical Requirements

- Enhance the `FileSearchTool` in `src/gunicorn.conf.py` to support more sophisticated search strategies
- Add file metadata processing to extract categories and other relevant information
- Implement a citation formatter that properly references source documents in responses
- Create parser modules for additional file formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Update the frontend to display source information more prominently in responses

## Acceptance Criteria

- Agent responses include clear citations with file names and sections
- Search results show improved relevance compared to the baseline implementation
- The system supports at least 2 additional file formats (PDF, DOCX)
- Documentation includes information about supported file types and how to optimize content for search
- Search performance (speed and relevance) meets or exceeds current implementation
