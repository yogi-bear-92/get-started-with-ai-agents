# Issue: Enhanced Security Features

## Description

While the project includes basic red teaming capabilities in `airedteaming/ai_redteaming.py`, there's room to enhance the security features to better protect against potential vulnerabilities, ensure content safety, and comply with privacy regulations.

## Implementation Tasks

1. Strengthen red teaming capabilities with additional attack vectors and scenarios
2. Implement content filtering options for inappropriate or harmful content
3. Add PII detection and redaction capabilities for sensitive information
4. Create comprehensive security audit logging for compliance purposes
5. Implement rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms

## Technical Requirements

- Enhance the `ai_redteaming.py` module with additional attack strategies and risk categories
- Integrate with Azure Content Safety or similar services for content filtering
- Add PII detection and redaction tools to process input and output text
- Implement detailed security logging with appropriate retention policies
- Create configuration options for security features (content filtering level, PII handling, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Red teaming module can detect a broader range of potential vulnerabilities
- Content filtering effectively blocks inappropriate or harmful content
- PII detection identifies and redacts sensitive information according to configuration
- Security logs provide comprehensive information for audit and compliance purposes
- Documentation includes guidance on security best practices and configuration options
