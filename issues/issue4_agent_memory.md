# Issue: Implement Agent Memory and Context Management

## Description

Currently, the AI agent operates with limited memory between sessions and doesn't maintain context across conversations. Adding persistent memory and context management would significantly enhance the user experience by allowing the agent to remember previous interactions and provide more personalized responses.

## Implementation Tasks

1. Implement conversation history storage in a database or Azure storage
2. Create mechanisms for retrieving relevant context from past conversations
3. Add user profile awareness to personalize responses based on user history
4. Implement configurable memory retention policies for data management
5. Update the agent interface to show awareness of conversation history

## Technical Requirements

- Add storage mechanisms for conversation history (Azure Tables, Cosmos DB, etc.)
- Implement context retrieval algorithms to find relevant past interactions
- Create a user profiling system to track preferences and common questions
- Add configuration options for memory retention (time-based, volume-based, etc.)
- Update the agent creation process to include memory and context capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria

- Agent can recall information from previous conversations with the same user
- Context retrieval improves response relevance based on conversation history
- User profiles enhance personalization of responses
- Memory retention policies comply with privacy requirements and user preferences
- The system remains performant even with extended conversation histories
