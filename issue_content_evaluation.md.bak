# Improve Agent Evaluation Framework

## Description

We should enhance our agent evaluation framework to provide more comprehensive quality metrics and automated testing.

## Current Behavior

- Basic evaluation through `evals/evaluate.py` with limited metrics
- Manual process for triggering evaluations
- Red teaming is separate from regular evaluation workflow

## Proposed Changes

- Add more evaluation metrics (e.g., response latency, hallucination detection)
- Create automated evaluation pipeline that runs on schedule
- Integrate red teaming into the standard evaluation workflow
- Implement a dashboard to visualize agent performance trends

## Expected Benefits

- Better understanding of agent quality over time
- Early detection of performance regression
- More comprehensive security and safety testing
- Data-driven approach to agent improvements

## Technical Requirements

- Extend `evals/evaluate.py` with additional evaluators
- Create CI/CD pipeline for automated evaluation
- Implement results storage for historical comparison
- Develop a simple visualization dashboard for metrics

## Additional Information

This improvement will help us measure progress and ensure our agent meets quality standards before deployment.
