# Enhance AI Agent with Better Knowledge Retrieval

## Description

Our current AI agent implementation could benefit from improved knowledge retrieval capabilities.

## Current Behavior

- The agent uses basic file search for retrieving knowledge
- Citations are sometimes inaccurate or missing
- Search relevance could be improved with better ranking

## Proposed Changes

- Implement better semantic ranking for file search results
- Improve citation generation to always reference the correct source
- Add support for more document types beyond current formats
- Consider integrating with Azure AI Search's hybrid search features

## Expected Benefits

- More accurate answers from the agent
- Better traceability through improved citations
- Enhanced user experience with more relevant responses

## Technical Requirements

- Update `src/gunicorn.conf.py` to modify agent search tools
- May require updates to embeddings generation in knowledge processing

## Additional Information

This enhancement aligns with the project's goal of demonstrating best practices for AI agent development.
