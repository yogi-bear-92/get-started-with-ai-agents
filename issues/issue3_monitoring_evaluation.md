# Issue: Improved Monitoring and Evaluation Framework [COMPLETED]

## Description

While the project already includes basic evaluation capabilities in the `evals/evaluate.py` module, there's an opportunity to enhance the monitoring and evaluation framework to provide more comprehensive insights into agent performance and behavior. This would help users better understand how their agents are performing and identify areas for improvement.

## Implementation Tasks

1. Expand the evaluation metrics in `evals/evaluate.py` to include more comprehensive criteria
2. Create a dashboard for visualization of evaluation results
3. Implement automated A/B testing between different agent configurations
4. Integrate evaluation results into the monitoring system
5. Add user feedback collection mechanisms to gather real-world performance data

## Technical Requirements

- Add new evaluators to the evaluation framework (e.g., response quality, answer correctness)
- Create a visualization component in the frontend to display evaluation metrics
- Implement an A/B testing framework that can compare different agent configurations
- Add APIs to collect and store user feedback on agent responses
- Update documentation with guidelines on interpreting evaluation results

## Acceptance Criteria

- Evaluation framework includes at least 3 new metrics beyond the current implementation
- Users can view evaluation results through a dashboard in the frontend
- The system supports A/B testing between different agent configurations
- User feedback can be collected and incorporated into evaluation metrics
- Documentation includes guidelines for interpreting evaluation results and improving agent performance
